            var captian = ["Mutualism is a symbiotic relationship in which both organisms benefit. In this example, the plant is passing its nutritious food, nectar and honey dew, to the hungry ants. In return, the ants protect the plant from herbivores, fungi, harmful pathogens, and other threatening insects. Here, the two organisms are exhibiting a service-resource type of relationship in which food resources are exchanged for a protection service. This type of mutualism is facultative, not obligatory, which means that although both the ant and plant are benefiting from the relationship, they do not depend on each other for survival.",
                                   
                            "Coniferous trees are classified as gymnosperms because they are cone-bearing rather than singular seed-bearing. Unlike deciduous trees, conifers have leaves that are needle shaped, which are retained all year-long due to their toughness, unfavorable tastes to insects, and ability to replace needles constantly. As a result, coniferous trees can photosynthesize throughout the year, even in the winter. This allows them to live in dry, arid climates with poor soil because they do not need a large supply of water and nutrients in the spring to regrow their leaves. Conifers and their leaves are ecologically important because they are the largest carbon sink on Earth, meaning that it removes and stores the most carbon from the atmosphere.",
                          
                           "Coniferous trees reproduce by producing tree cones that release seeds. The female pine cone contains eggs(ovules) that, when fertilized by the pollen produced by male cones such as the one shown in this image, become seeds. Unlike female cones, male cones will drop to the ground soon after their pollen as been released. The  female cones, on the other hand, remain in the tree and protect their seeds by enclosing their scales until the conditions are right. After the seeds are fully developed the conditions are appropriate, the female cone will release its seeds in order to produce the offspring.",
                           
                           "Chitin (C8H13O5N), in it pure form, is a long, semitransparent polysaccharide that shares a similar structure as that of cellulose. It is found in the cell walls of fungi, defining not only shape and structure but also behavior of fungi, such as vegetative growth, reproduction, and dispersal. Due to the structural advantages and strength of its modified forms, Chitin also forms the exoskeletons in arthropods, nematodes, and insects; for example, chitin is a characteristic component of butterfly wings, the surface of caterpillar bodies, and shells of crustaceans.",
                           
                           "Bryophytes, such as mosses, are primitive plants that do not have vascular tissue and therefore cannot transport fluids and nutrients internally. As a result, bryophytes must live in moist environments and transport water via osmosis. Like all land plants, bryophytes have alternation of generations, which is a term used to describe the sexual life cycle of plants. However, unlike tracheophytes, many of which are sporophyte dominant and reproduce via seeds and flowers, bryophytes are gametophyte dominant and reproduce by spores. This means that not only is the plant haploid for most of its life, but the sporophyte is nutritionally dependent on the gametophyte, only living temporarily to produce spores by meiosis.",
                           
                           "The anther and filament of the stamen are both essential for sexual reproduction in flowering plants. The anther is the male part of the flower where pollen, the sperm, is produced. Most anthers contain four microsporangia, which are enclosures in the stamen that produce haploid spores via meiosis. These spores are then further divided to form pollen grains, which are carried by pollinators to other flowers for fertilization. The thread-like structure that supports the anther is called the filament.",
                           
                           "Dicot plants are complex flowering plants that have distinguishing characteristics in the number of leaves, number of cotyledons, leaf venation, and structure. You can immediately tell if a flower is dicot by looking at the number of leaves it has; if the leaves come in multiples of 4s or 5s, as does this flower, then the plant is dicot. Additionally, unlike monocots, dicots have two cotyledons(embryonic seed leaves), netlike leaf veins, and vascular bundles that are organized in a ring around the edge of the stem. Examples of dicot plants include roses, daisies, carrots, walnut trees, and cherry trees.",
                           
                           "A plant cuticle is a layer of wax-impregnated lipid polymer that protects the epidermis of leaves and other organs of vascular plants. Its main function is to prevent evaporation of water from the surface in order to limit water loss. In addition, the plant cuticle prevents entrance of outside water, solutes, dirt, and microorganisms that could potentially contaminate the plant. By conserving water and keeping out dangerous contaminates, the plant cuticle increases the plant's chances of survival and improves the fitness of offspring.",
                           
                           "Autotrophs are organisms that make their own food, which include organic compounds such as carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. Autotrophs are either phototrophs or chemoautotrophs. The former converts light energy into chemical energy for fuel, a proccess known as photosynthesis. Unlike phototrophs, the latter uses the oxidation of electron donors as a source of energy because they are most commonly found in environments that do not receive sunlight, such as the ocean floor. All plants and water algae are autotrophs and are fundamental to any food chain, as they provide heterotrophs and all animals food and energy to survive.",
                           
                           "Angiosperms are classified as tracheophytes, meaning that they have transport vessels and reproduce by seeds. However, unlike gymnosperms, angiosperms are flowering plants in which seeds are produced inside the ovaries of flowers, which eventually turn into the fruit. Angiosperms are further subdivided into two more groups: monocots and dicots. Monocots are simple grasses that include wheat, corn, oats and rice. Dicots are more complex, including the red flowering plant shown here, roses, carrots, cherry trees, and more.",
                           
                            "An plant or animal that is radially symmetrical can be divided into three or more identical sectors with respect to the central axis. These organisms are classified in the taxa Radiata. This flower shown here has radial symmetry because 3 or more planes can form symmetrical parts around the origin, which in this case is the style and stigma. In animals, radial symmetry is often found in cnidarians and echinoderms, including jellyfish, sea anemones, and starfish. Most viruses are also radially symmetrical, as their protein molecules are usually arranged in the shape of spheres, polyhedrons, ovoids, and icosahedrons.",
                           
                           "The stigma, together with the style and ovary, make up the pistil, which is the female reproductive organ of the flower. It is located at the top of the style where it receives pollen from pollinators in a variety of ways. The pollen can be caught via the air from flying pollinators such as bees, butterflies, and birds. Or, pollen can be captured by water through Hydrophily, a form of pollination by which pollen is distributed by the flow of water. Once the stigma becomes pollinated, the plant can germinate and grow. ",
                           
                           "The plant stem is one of two main structural parts of a plant. The stem is divided into two parts: nodes and internodes. Nodes hold leaves and branches while internodes is the distance between two nodes. The primary function of the stem is to provide support to the plant, elevating it so that it can receive as much sunlight as possible. Stems also transport water and nutrients through transport vessels such as the phloem and xylem. Furthermore, because stems have meristems, cells that can generate new tissue, it can also produce new living tissue for the plant as needed.",
                           
                           "The phloem is one of two main transport tissues of a plant that is located within the vascular cylinder, underneath the xylem, and above the spongy layer of the leaves. Its primary function is to transport sucrose to all parts of the plant that need it. It carries out this task by a process known as translocation, during which the phloem vessels carry sugar from photosynthetic parts of the plant(the leaves) to the parts of the plant lacking sugar. Because translocation is a process that requires energy, the phloem consists of both sieve tube elements and companion cells. The sieve tube elements’ main job is the transportation of sucrose; however, because the tubes lack ribosomes, vacuoles, and a nucleus, they depend on companion cells to provide them with ATP and proteins for energy.",
                           
                           "The xylem is one of two main transport vessels in a plant that is located within the vascular bundle of the leaf above the phloem underneath the palisade layer. Its cell walls consist of lignin, a material that not only helps support the plant but also allows it to transport nutrients and water. From the soil, the xylem carries its materials to the root, stem, and leaves of a plant without using any energy. The xylem is able to transport the nutrients and water to the rest of the plant against gravity by a process known as transpirational pull-cohesion tension, a theory stating that for each molecule of water that evaporates from a leaf via transpiration, another molecule is drawn at the root via cohesion tension to replace it.",

You can immediately tell if a flower is monocot by looking at the number of leaves it has; if the leaves come in multiples of 3s, as does this flower, then the plant is monocot. Additionally, unlike dicots, monocots have only one cotyledons(embryonic seed leaves), parallel leaf veins, and vascular bundles that are scattered rather than organized in a ring. Examples of monocot plants include wheat, corn, oats, grass, and rice.",
                          
                           "The flower ovary is a reproductive organ in a flower where fertilization occurs. Once a pollinator has delivered its pollen to the flower, one single pollen grain containing one tube nucleus and two sperm nuclei lands on the stigma of the flower. The pollen grain then germinates and produces a pollen tube that extends to the ovary, a pathway that the two sperm nuclei travel through to enter ovary and ovule. One sperm nucleus becomes the embryo by fertilizing the egg while the other becomes the endosperm, which is the food for the embryo. After fertilization occurs, the ovule becomes the seed, and the ovary becomes the fruit, which is responsible for dispersing the seed in the ovule that contains the embryo.",

This hormone is released as a response to environmental stress, such as heat, water, or salt stress. For example, during the winter, abscisic acid is produced to slow plant growth and instead use the energy to develop scales that will protect the buds during in the cold. When there is a lack of water, ABA is produced and causes the stomata to close in hopes to reduce transpiration and conserve water. When exposed to salty conditions, the plant produces the hormone in the endodermis to prevent the roots from growing.",

Its primary function is to produce gametes that then participate in fertilization to produce a diploid zygote, which has 2 sets of chromosomes instead of 1. When the zygote undergoes cell division, a new diploid organism is formed. This is also known as the sporophyte, which is the second stage of the plant sexual life cycle.

Carbon dioxide and oxygen constantly enter and exit the leaf through the stomata during photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Additionally, during transpiration, water vapor is released into the atmosphere via these pores. Guard cells form and adjust the size of the stomates as a response to environmental necessity or stress. For example, when the plant needs to take in CO2 or oxygen, the opening of the stomates will widen. Or, if a plant is undergoing a drought, the guard cells will decrease the opening of the stomates as an effort to conserve water.",

Bees in particular are adapted to pollination, as their fuzziness and electrostatic charge allow the pollen grains to stick to their bodies. Additionally, the hind-legs of bees have a structure, known as the corbicula or “pollen basket”, that makes it easier to carry around pollen. Many pollinators are insects, such as bees, wasps, ants, and butterflies.

This usually happens when there is competition among organisms for limited resources, such as nutrients, moisture, and territory, as it forces organisms to maximize the occupied area by being as far away from one another as possible, resulting in equidistance. For example, many plants, such as Salvia leucophylla, exhibit uniform spacing to maximize nutrients and water. Penguins also tend to  be dispersed uniformly because they must defend their territory from neighbors. Other plants release chemicals like terpenes that inhibits the growth of other surrounding plants to achieve uniform dispersion, a process known as allelopathy.",

Alcoholic fermentation converts sugars into alcohol and produces C02 as a waste product. It has many practical uses, including the production of alcohol, fuel, and baking of bread. In bread, yeast organisms eat the sugars in the dough and produce both ethanol and carbon dioxide; the C02 causes the bread to form bubbles and rise when baked. The second type of fermentation is lactic acid fermentation, which occurs when the cells lack oxygen to produce enough ATP for the organism.
